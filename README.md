## Description

The **BC Economic Development Dashboard** is an interactive platform that illustrates a comprehensive set of indicators related to the cleanness and inclusiveness of the economy of British Columbia. This dashboard aligns with the six missions of the StrongerBC Economic Plan, providing users with insights into the province's progress across various economic and social dimensions. The indicators are categorized into six distinct areas, each corresponding to a specific mission:

- **MISSION 1: Supporting People and Families**
- **MISSION 2: Building Resilient Communities**
- **MISSION 3: Advancing True, Lasting, and Meaningful Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples**
- **MISSION 4: Meeting B.C.â€™s Climate Commitments**
- **MISSION 5: Leading on Environmental and Social Responsibility**
- **MISSION 6: Fostering Innovation across the Economy**

Each mission is represented through a series of relevant indicators, which are visualized using interactive charts. These visualizations enable stakeholders to assess the province's performance and identify areas for improvement in real-time.

## Features
